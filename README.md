# C++ Day of Birthday

It's been ages since I last wrote a c++ program; so this is just my feeble attempt to get back into the C++ game.

To debug this program...
* Get Visual Studio Code
* Enable debugging of C++ code by following https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp
* Check out/download this code
* open the folder in Visual Studio Code
* debug away!
